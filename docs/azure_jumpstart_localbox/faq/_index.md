# Jumpstart LocalBox Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is Jumpstart LocalBox?

Jumpstart LocalBox is a turnkey solution that provides a complete sandbox for exploring Azure Local capabilities and hybrid cloud integration in a virtual environment. LocalBox is designed to be completely self-contained within a single Azure subscription and resource group, which makes it easy for users to get hands-on with Azure Local and Azure Arc technology without the need for physical hardware.

> **Note:** For general questions about Arc Jumpstart please see the [Jumpstart FAQ](../../faq/).

## What is required to deploy LocalBox?

LocalBox deployment requires an Azure service principal with Owner role-based access control (RBAC) on an Azure subscription and resource group and can be deployed using Azure Bicep. A service principal is required to run the automation scripts that deploy and configure LocalBox features. You can view how the service principal is used by exploring the LocalBox code on our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc).
