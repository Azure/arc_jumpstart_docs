# Jumpstart HCIBox Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is Jumpstart HCIBox?

Jumpstart HCIBox is a turnkey solution that provides a complete sandbox for exploring Azure Stack HCI capabilities and hybrid cloud integration in a virtual environment. HCIBox is designed to be completely self-contained within a single Azure subscription and resource group, which makes it easy for users to get hands-on with Azure Stack HCI and Azure Arc technology without the need for physical hardware.

> **Note:** For general questions about Arc Jumpstart please see the [Jumpstart FAQ](../../faq/).

## What is required to deploy HCIBox?

HCIBox deployment requires an Azure service principal with Owner role-based access control (RBAC) on an Azure subscription and resource group and can be deployed using Azure Bicep. A service principal is required to run the automation scripts that deploy and configure HCIBox features. You can view how the service principal is used by exploring the HCIBox code on our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc).

## What Azure regions can HCIBox be deployed to?

HCIBox has been tested in the following Azure regions. Some HCIBox resources are deployed in specific regions where required services are available.

- East US
- Australia East
- Canada Central
- West Europe
