# Jumpstart Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Can I contribute to the Arc Jumpstart?

Absolutely! Arc Jumpstart is a community-driven open-source project, and contributions are welcomed. To get started, review the [Jumpstart contribution guidelines](../contribution_guidelines/) and our [Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/JumpstartCOC).

## Are any of the Arc Jumpstart documents created with AI assistance?

Yes, some of our documentation was created with the assistance of AI tools. Our team follows [Microsoft’s principles for AI-generated content](https://learn.microsoft.com/principles-for-ai-generated-content) and thoroughly reviews AI-assisted content to ensure it meets high standards for quality and accuracy. You can find more details in our [AI disclaimer](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs/blob/main/AI_DISCLAIMER.MD).

## Can I use an Azure free trial account with Arc Jumpstart?

Yes, you can use an Azure [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). However, some Jumpstart features may require additional Azure consumption isn’t provided in a free trial.

## Does the Arc Jumpstart provide free credit to Azure or other cloud providers?

Arc Jumpstart does not provide free credit to Azure or any other cloud providers. To use the Jumpstart you must provide your own environments to run any of the scenarios or solutions.

## What permissions do I need to deploy Arc Jumpstart scenarios and solutions?

Each Arc Jumpstart scenario and solution describes what is needed to run the automation — take a look at the prerequisites section. Most of them will ask you to create a service principal, so you will need an Azure **User Access Administrator** or **Role Base Access Control Administrator** permissions.

## Is Arc Jumpstart considered "production-ready"?

The intention of the Arc Jumpstart is to focus on the core Azure Arc, edge, and IoT capabilities, deployment scenarios, use cases, and ease of use. It does not focus on Azure best practices, and/or other products or open-source projects being leveraged in our code. Jumpstart Scenarios, ArcBox, HCIBox, and Agora are all intended for evaluation, training, and demo purposes only and are not supported for production use cases.

## Is there guidance on how to run a demo using the Arc Jumpstart?

You can get additional information and insights on how to use Arc Jumpstart on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@azurearcjumpstart).

## What if something doesn’t work?

If you have any issues or questions, please [open a GitHub issue](https://aka.ms/JumpstartIssue), and one of our Jumpstart core maintainers or community members will address it as soon as possible. For any Azure product-related issues, please open a [support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket).

## Can I suggest improvements and features?
