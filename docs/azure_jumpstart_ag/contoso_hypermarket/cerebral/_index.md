## Data integration and query processing

At the heart of Cerebral's architecture lies a sophisticated data integration system that seamlessly connects diverse information sources through an intelligent query processing pipeline. This unified approach transforms how organizations access and utilize their operational data.

### Unified data sources

The system orchestrates three specialized databases, each optimized for specific types of information and query patterns:

- **InfluxDB** powers Cerebral's real-time operational insights by managing time-series data from store equipment and systems. This specialized database captures everything from refrigeration temperatures to checkout queue lengths, enabling rapid analysis of current conditions and historical trends. Its optimized time-series capabilities ensure swift access to performance metrics and environmental data when seconds matter.

  - Captures real-time metrics from store equipment
  - Monitors system performance data
  - Tracks operational status
  - Stores historical trending data

> **Note**: For additional details, please refer to the ["MQTT simulated equipment metrics"](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs/blob/canary/docs/azure_jumpstart_ag/contoso_hypermarket/cerebral/cerebral_appendix.md#mqtt-simulated-equipment-metrics) section in the Jumpstart Cerebral appendix file.

- **SQL Server** handles all commercial operations data, providing a robust foundation for business intelligence. From transaction processing to inventory management, this relational database ensures accurate tracking of sales patterns, stock levels, and customer interactions, enabling data-driven decision making across the organization.

  - Manages transaction records
  - Tracks inventory levels
  - Stores customer data
  - Handles business intelligence queries

> **Note**: For additional details on the relational database structure and how it is used by Contoso Hypermarket for commercial and operational needs, please refer to the ["Relational database structure"](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs/blob/canary/docs/azure_jumpstart_ag/contoso_hypermarket/cerebral/cerebral_appendix.md#relational-database-structure) section in the Jumpstart Cerebral appendix file.

- **Chroma Vector Database** serves as the foundation for Cerebral's documentation intelligence. By indexing technical manuals, maintenance procedures, and operational guides, it enables sophisticated semantic search capabilities through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows Cerebral to understand the context and intent behind documentation queries, delivering precise and relevant information to users.
  
  - Stores and indexes technical documentation
  - Enables semantic search capabilities
  - Manages operational procedures and maintenance guides
  - Facilitates contextual information retrieval

### Available technical manuals

All technical documentation is automatically indexed and processed by Cerebral's RAG system, enabling natural language queries about any aspect of these systems. Instead of manually searching through PDFs, users can simply ask Cerebral specific questions about equipment operation, maintenance procedures, or troubleshooting steps.

> **Note**: For a list of the various technical manuals used by Contoso Hypermarket for operational needs, please refer to the ["Available technical manuals"](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs/blob/canary/docs/azure_jumpstart_ag/contoso_hypermarket/cerebral/cerebral_appendix.md#Available-technical-manuals) section in the Jumpstart Cerebral appendix file.

### Intelligent query routing

When a user interacts with Cerebral, their natural language query flows through a sophisticated decision tree that determines the optimal processing path. Questions about maintenance procedures are seamlessly routed to the vector database, equipment status checks are directed to the time-series database, and sales inquiries are processed through the relational database. This intelligent routing ensures that each query is handled by the most appropriate system, delivering fast, accurate responses while maintaining system efficiency.

For example, when a maintenance technician asks _"How do I calibrate Scale-02?"_, Cerebral recognizes this as a documentation query and leverages RAG to search the vector database for relevant procedures. Conversely, a store manager asking "What were our top-selling products today?" triggers a SQL query to analyze recent transaction data.
