# Observability

Contoso Hypermarket uses advanced monitoring and visualization tools, including Azure IoT, Grafana, Prometheus, and Kubernetes observability, to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Real-time dashboards provide insights into asset performance, such as refrigerators and HVAC systems, through an edge-to-cloud pipeline, enabling predictive maintenance, reducing downtime, and extending asset lifespan.

In-store, computer vision and point-of-sale data optimize product placement and employee efficiency, while customizable dashboards support data-driven decisions and trend analysis. This framework enhances resource optimization, ensures reliable system health, and delivers a seamless retail experience.
