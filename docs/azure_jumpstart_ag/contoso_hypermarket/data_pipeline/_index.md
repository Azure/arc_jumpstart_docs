# Data Pipelines

Contoso Hypermarket aims to leverage store data through cloud-based data pipelines to drive business intelligence. Two main data pipelines, the operational and commercial, have been developed to streamline dataflow from stores nationwide for effective collection, processing, and analysis in the cloud.

The **operational** data pipeline focuses on optimizing store orders and inventory management, enabling corporate leadership to generate insights that enhance operational efficiency and support informed decision-making. Similarly, the **commercial** data pipeline provides critical insights that help forecast demand and improve inventory management, ultimately enhancing overall business performance and strategic planning across the organization.

Together, these pipelines give Contoso's leadership a comprehensive view of store operations, helping identify trends and meet customer demand effectively.
