# Jumpstart ArcBox for IT Pros - Azure Monitor Workbooks

ArcBox for IT Pros is a special "flavor" of ArcBox that is intended for users who want to experience Azure Arc-enabled servers capabilities in a sandbox environment. This document provides specific guidance on the included ArcBox [Azure Monitor Workbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview). Please refer to the main [ArcBox documentation](../../../ITPro/) for information on deploying and using ArcBox.

As part of ArcBox for IT Pros, two Azure Monitor workbooks is deployed to provide a single pane of glass for monitoring and reporting on ArcBox resources. Using Azure's management and operations tools in hybrid, multi-cloud and edge deployments provides the consistency needed to manage each environment through a common set of governance and operations management practices. The Azure Monitor workbooks acts as a flexible canvas for data analysis and visualization in the Azure portal, gathering information from several data sources from across ArcBox and combining them into an integrated interactive experience.

   > **Note:** Due to the number of Azure resources included in a single ArcBox deployment and the data ingestion and analysis required, it is expected that metrics and telemetry for the workbook can take several hours to be fully available.

You are able to monitor your connected machine guest operating system performance at the scope of the resource with VM insights. In ArcBox for IT Pros the Azure Arc-enabled servers have been onboarded onto Azure Monitor.

The _Azure Arc-enabled servers OS Performance_ Workbook shows metrics and alerts for ArcBox for IT Pros resources organized in three sections:
