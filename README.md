## Branch guidance

The Arc Jumpstart docs repository handles branching similarly to most code repositories. Two primary branches are maintained, each one attached to a specific website slot (prod/canary). 

The following branches are currently maintained:

| Branch                                                       | Website                    | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [main](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs) (primary)               | https://arcjumpstart.com/       | Latest Arc Jumpstart release documentation. This is the latest documentation available in the deployed to the production slot. |
| [canary](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs/tree/canary) (canary) | https://preview.arcjumpstart.com/ | Pre-release documentation. Doc updates should be merged to the canary branch for preview validation before merging to the main branch. |
